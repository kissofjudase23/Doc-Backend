## FAQ
  * [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
  * [TCP vs UDP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5970383/difference-between-tcp-and-udp)


## IPv4
  * Net_ID, Host_ID, CIDR(netmask)
  * ClassA-E:
  * Public IP, Private IP
  * DHCP
  * Ref:
    * Onenote
    * https://www.jannet.hk/zh-Hant/post/IP-Address-Version-4-IPv4/
    * https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18752_01/html/816-4554/ipplan-5.html#exlvx


## IPv6
 * Prefix, Subnet ID, Interface ID, CIDR
 * Global Unitcast Address, Link Local Address (fe80::interfaice-ID/10)
 * EUI-64
   * This feature is a key benefit over IPv4 as it eliminates the need of manual configuration or DHCP as in the world of IPv4.
   * The IPv6 EUI-64 format address is obtained through the 48-bit MAC address. .

## DNS
  * Domain Name System
  * ![Hierarchy](./images/hierarchy.png)
    * For maps.google.com, first, the DNS recursor will contact the root name server. The root name server will redirect it to .com domain name server. .com name server will redirect it to google.com name server. google.com name server will find the matching IP address for maps.google.com in its’ DNS records and return it to your DNS recursor which will send it back to your browser.
  * Resource Record:
    * SOA:
      * Start of authorith
    * PTR Record :
      * Pointer, transfer IP to Domain
      * example:
        ```shell
        $ dig -x 52.38.127.248
        ```
    * NS:
      * Get domain of the service domain
      * example:
        ```shell
        # 1. get the domain of the service domain (from.ers.trendmicro.com )
        $ dig NS from.ers.trendmicro.com

        # 2. get the service IP of the domain
        $ dig A hashsrv.ers.trendmicro.com
        ```
    * MX:
      * Mail exchange
    * A:
      * IPv4 Answer
      * **Maps a name to one or more IP addresses**, when the IP are known and stable.
    * AAAA:
      * IPv6 Answer
    * CNAME:
      * Canonical name
      * Maps a name to another name. It should only be used when there are no other records on that name.
      * One Cname can map to 1 domain (1-to-1).
    * Alias:
      * Maps a name to another name, but in turns it can **coexist** with other records on that name.
      * One Alias can map to Mutliple domain(1-to-many).
    * URL
      * Redirects the name to the target name using the HTTP 301 status cod
